# morphlabproject

The goal of this project is to build a two-link planar oscillating robotic arm. This can be used to train a sleeve for a human's arm that will counteract tremours in the patient so they can live their life as normally as possible.

The project is split into the following stages:
1. Develop a simulation of the two-link, planar robotic arm using ROS.
2. Build the robot and test it.
3. Build a sleeve for the robot and train it to counteract the robot's tremours. 

We are a team of three students, Camilla Giulia Billari, Yuken Ge and Hannah Knight, working at the Morphlab, Imperial College London, under the supervision of Professor Thrishantha Nanayakkara.
